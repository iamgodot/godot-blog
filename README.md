# Godot-blog

The blog is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) as base theme.

Config file is [here](config.yml), see for details. Google Analytics is used for statistics and [Waline](https://waline.js.org/en/) for commenting.

When new commits are pushed, [an update workflow](.github/workflows/update.yml) will be triggered to build and publish the site with the latest changes.
