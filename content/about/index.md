# About Me

I work on *Web Development* and write *Python* code mostly. My interests spread on *Open Source*, *Linux Distros*,
*Command Line* and a lot more. BTW, I use *Arch* (sarcastic meaning).

Things I would keep on *preaching and practicing* :

- Be kind
- Reading
- Exercising
- *Minimalism*
- Exploring the world

Tools I found *useful and elegant* :

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [Typora](https://typora.io/)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [Picgo](https://picgo.github.io/PicGo-Doc/en/guide/#picgo-is-here)
- [Taskito](https://taskito.io/)
- [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/)

As for dreams, *freelance developer* sounds pretty cool.

# About the Site

As mentioned in homepage, I've tried various platforms, while ending up with *Hugo*.

Several reasons to get back on a static page generator:

1. No more import&export via miscellaneous formats.
1. With *Picgo* I can easily manage image uploading.
1. I got to use local editors such as *Vim* and *Typora*.
1. [Shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) enforcement to plain *Markdown*.
1. [Multi Comment systems integration](https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/#alternatives).

*Hugo* files of this site is maintained [here](https://github.com/iamgodot/godot-blog), and by *GitHub Actions*
[an update workflow](https://github.com/iamgodot/godot-blog/blob/master/.github/workflows/update.yml)
will be triggered upon new commits for auto-deployment.
