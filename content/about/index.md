I always feel confused about this. Sometimes I write, then modify and archive. Sometimes I give up, after a while it drives me back. I guess that's a sign of true love, which doesn't always bring joy. Nonetheless, I'm still open up to all the uncertainties, and that's why this blog is still here.

To be continued.
