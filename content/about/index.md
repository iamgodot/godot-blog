Shortly, I'm a realistic idealist. But why keeping a blog? Well, first of all, it helps me think:

> Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard.

Secondly, it becomes a good way to organize and share my thoughts. Moreover, writing turns out to be 1 thing that I've been sticking to, maybe not intensively, yet persistently.

As a developer, I also build my own projects:

- [Cilantro](https://github.com/iamgodot/cilantro): An async web framework(WIP).
- [Almond](https://github.com/iamgodot/almond): A RAG application for optimizing resumes.
- [Cashew](https://github.com/iamgodot/cashew): A simple chat app.
- [Py-tldr](https://github.com/iamgodot/py-tldr): A Python client for tldr.
- [Create-python-app](https://github.com/iamgodot/create-python-app): A CLI tool to create Python packages.
- [Dotfiles](https://github.com/iamgodot/dotfiles): My dotfiles and bootstrap scripts for MacOS and Arch.

Additionally, here're some of the things I enjoy:

- Note-taking: With Obsidian.
- Cooking: Mostly Chinese cuisine.
- Exercising: Sometimes stretching.
- Planting: My cilantros are growing well:)
